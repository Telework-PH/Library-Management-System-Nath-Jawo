Design Decisions

The design of the library management system was based on the following principles:

Ease of use: The system should be easy to use for both librarians and library users.
Flexibility: The system should be flexible enough to accommodate the needs of different libraries.
Scalability: The system should be scalable to accommodate the growth of a library's collection.

The following were some of the challenges encountered during the project:

Data migration: The system required the migration of data from the library's existing manual system. 
This was a challenging task, as the data was not always in a consistent format.
Testing: The system was thoroughly tested to ensure that it was working properly. This included both unit testing and integration testing.
Conclusion

During the development of our Library Management System, we faced several challenges that tested our problem-solving skills and teamwork. 
One of the biggest challenges was designing an efficient algorithm for searching and updating book records in the database.
To overcome this challenge, we researched various algorithms and data structures and implemented a hash table-based solution that significantly improved the performance of the system. 
Another challenge we faced was ensuring the security of the system and protecting the data of the library and its patrons. 
We implemented several security measures such as encryption of sensitive data and user authentication to address this challenge.
